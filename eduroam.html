      <h1>Connect Your Wee Archlet Cluster to Eduroam</h1>
      <p>
        Since connecting a device to eduroam is not as simple as entering an ssid and password, you will have to put quite a bit more information
        into your wpa_supplicant.conf file than shown in the main instructions!
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to a valid eduroam login, you will need to know certain details specific to your institution - there should be manual/Linux configuration istructions on
        their website. For example, Edinburgh University's are at: <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/wifi-networking/configure-device/eduroam-generic">
        https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/wifi-networking/configure-device/eduroam-generic</a>
      </p>
      <h2>What to Do</h2>
      <ol>
        <p>
          Open wpa_supplicant.conf as shown in the Wee Archlet instructions.
        </p>
        <pre>
  sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        </pre>
        <p>
          And still add the <code>network</code> field at the bottom with "eduroam" as the ssid.
        </p>
        <pre>
  network={
    ssid="eduroam"
  }
        </pre>
        <p>
          As I said, there's more to come. Add the following four lines underneath <code>ssid</code>, but replace the placeholder text with your own login details, and the correct values
          based on your institution's configuration document. I found the certificate I needed was already in the /etc/ssl/certs directory, but you may need to download yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Remember that you have your secret password saved in this file, in case you think about sharing your cluster, or your configuration file with anyone!
        </p>
        <pre>
  identity="&lt;your_username&gt;"
  password="&lt;your_password&gt;"
  ca_cert="/etc/ssl/certs/&lt;relevant_authentication_certificate&gt;.pem"
  eap=&lt;supported_EAP_authentication&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>
          And finally, add the following just as it is:
        </p>
        <pre>
  phase1="peaplabel=0"
  phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
  priority=10
  disabled=0
  scan_ssid=0
  mode=0
  auth_alg=OPEN
  proto=WPA RSN
  pairwise=CCMP TKIP
  key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
  proactive_key_caching=1
        </pre>

        <p>
          This is what my file for connecting to eduroam in Edinburgh looks like (minus secret information):
        </p>

        <pre>
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1
  country=GB
  network={
          identity="uun@ed.ac.uk"
          password="password"
          ca_cert="/etc/ssl/certs/QuoVadis_Root_CA_2.pem"
          eap=PEAP
          phase1="peaplabel=0"
          phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
          priority=10
          disabled=0
          ssid="eduroam"
          scan_ssid=0
          mode=0
          auth_alg=OPEN
          proto=WPA RSN
          pairwise=CCMP TKIP
          key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
          proactive_key_caching=1

  }
        </pre>
        <p>
          Hopefully this has helped you get connected. You can check if you were successful by returning to the main instructions and continuing from where you left off.

          We found these settings worked for us in Edinburgh, please let us know if you have any problems by opening a new issue <a href="https://www.github.com/EPCCed/wee_archlet/issues">on our GitHub page.</a>
